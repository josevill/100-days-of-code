# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 4th, 2017
##### Setting up

**Today's Progress**: Configured a Laravel installation, made some database structure mockups on the blackboard and front-end views wireframing.

**Thoughts**: I don't know if i should be working with Laravel itself or use Lumen as this project won't be that 'big', but you never know.

**Link(s) to work**: [It's not yet setup on the we](http://kbono.xyz/brackets)
